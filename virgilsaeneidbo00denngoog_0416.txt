155. enses: the sacrificial lmives. All the holy objects Sinon appeals to
are witnesses 01 the outrage he has
sullered, and 01 his -being bound by
no tie 01 loyalty to his countrymen.

165. Fatale: ‘iatelul'; the Palladium was so termed because the sate 01
Troy depended on its preservation. 1t was a small, rude image 01 Pallas,
‚which was believed to have fallen from heaven, and was guarded hy the Tro-
jans with great care.

168. vittas: the lillets round the head 01 the image.

166. liuere, referri: historical infinitives. This metaphor seems to be
drawn from the movement 01 1 ship which the rowers have ccased to propel

176. That an image should show such miraculous signs 01 anger is a suffi-
cient reason to the minds 01 the Troiam, as Sinon is well aware, 101 the advice
01 Calchas and the hasty departure 01 the Greeks. There is, therefore, no
difficulty now in believing that the Greeks have actually gone, and that what
Sinon adds about the destination 01 the wooden horse is reasonable and

true.
