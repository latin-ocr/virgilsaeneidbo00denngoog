[Novis. -The parts of compound words are not indicated separately when they
appear unmodified in the compound form, nor when prepositions in composition
are modified only according to the general rules mentioned under the definitions
of prepositions.

ln verbs, only the principal parts are given which are understood to be in actual
use; and generally one of the numerals, r. 2, 3, 4, designates the conjugation, and
therefore the form of the infinitive.

The numerals following definitione refer to passages in the text]
