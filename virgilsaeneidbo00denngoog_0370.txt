72. Quarum quae, etc.: ‘and Deiopea, who (is) the lairest os these in
heauty, I will unite to you in lasting wedlock, and pronounce your own.'

The nominative, Deiopea, is put by attraction in the case ol the relative quae,
instead ol the accusative, which would bave been the regular construction.
H. 399, 3, A. 200, b3 B. 251, 4; G. 616; (H. 445, 9). Quarum is trans·

ion, such as it is.’ soeptra: as above, l. 57, and below, l. 253, indicates
the kingly power with somewhat more sullness than the singular number.
