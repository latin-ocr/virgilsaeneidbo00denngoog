NOTES

BOOK 1

Ille ego, qui quondam gracili modulatus avena
Carmen, et egressus silvis, vicino coigr'
Ut quamvis avido parerent arva colono,
Gratum opus agricolis: ot nunc horrentia Martis.

THE above verses are usually placed, in the editions oi Virgik at the begin·
ning oi the Aeneid, but printed'iu alorm diilerent irom that oi the text, as an
indication that there is a question as to their authenticity‚ and as to their
proper connection with the poem. They were known to Servius, the great

commentator ouVirgil, and seem not unworthy ol the poet. But, on the ,

other hand, the lines are not found in the best manuscripts, while “all
antiquity,” as Ribbeck says, “recognizes the words arma virumque as the
beginning oi the poem.'’ They were thus understood by Propertius and
quoted by Ovid, contemporaries practically oi the poet, and by the later
writers, Martial and Persius. It is possible that these tour lines were prefixed
by the poet to one or more copies os the first book presented to personal
friends. At any rate, although they may be Virgilian, they should not form
part of the text.

Trans: Ἰ, that poet who¹ formerly tuned my song with the slender pipe,
and (then) coming forth from the wood (ie. dismissing sylvan or pastoral
themes) taught the neighboring fields to sulfill the desire os the husbandmen,
however greedy (ie. made his labors iruitlul through the teachings of my
poems on husbandry), a work (oi song) acceptable to the tillers oi the soil:
yet now sing the bristling arms ol Mars!

ego: sc. cano. Ι
vicinae ‘neighboring’ near by the woods, implying that the subjects of the
Bucolics and Georgics are nearly related.
horrentia: the idea oi ‘ terrible’ or ‘dreadiul’ is occasionally associated, as
perhaps here, with the literal meaning oi horrens.
