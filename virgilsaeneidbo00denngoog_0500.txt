,the Chimaera and the goaland, having passed round it, turns back toward
the shore, leaving Gyas behind. He in his fury casts the pilot overboard‚ and
takes the helm himself. Meanwhile Mnestheus and Sergestus are vieing with
each other to pass the Chimaera. Sergestus at first has the advantage, but
only by a part of the ship's length, and, in his eagerness to round the goal at
the nearest point, runs his ship on the rocks. The Pristis rushes by, and now

strives to overtake the Scylla. But Cloanthus prays to the gods of the sea, Ι

with whose aid the ship speeds to the land, and receives the first prize, while
that of Mnestheus takes the second, and the Chimaera the third. Sergestus,
. with difficulty, brings his ship to land.
