20 INTRODUCTION

Augustus Caesar and his adoptive father, Julius Caesar, claimed

descent through the Julian gens from Iulus, Aeneas, and the god· ᾖ

dess Venus. The real purpose of the Aeneid, as a national cpio,
was the glorification of Augustus and the culmination ol events

under his wise and beneficent rule. This could hedone inno χ

better or more effective way than by depicting the wanderings

in Book VI, where Anchises points out to Aeneas the souls that are
to return to the upper world and become distinguished Romans ol
future generations. At the same time the Aeneid is conceived
upon a large scale, covering as it does the history of the establish-
ment os Roman greatness‚ and, partly by way ofintimation, ol all suc·
ceeding events, culminating with the rule of the Emperor Augustus.

ln two ways the Aeneid differs from its Greek models In the
first place it belongs to the type of the literary epic, in distinction
from the Iliad and Odyssey, which belong to the class of primitive
epics. The latter are the spontaneous narration os early legends
and traditions. They are characterized by a charming natural-
