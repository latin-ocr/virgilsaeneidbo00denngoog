tbe Paradise Lost. The authors of these two epics arethe ’
greatest os all plagiarists ; but the borrowed thought in both ol
thern assumes so much ol their individuality that their plagiarism
becomes a beauty aud a virtue. They are plagiarists os the older
poets in the same sense that the painter is a plagiarist os nature.

But while the Aeneid, through the premature death of the poet,
hasbeen left to us somewhat incomplete, and while it claims no
great degree ol originality, but is largely the offspring, not of Vir-
gil alone, but of the genius ol all antiquity, it has always been, aud
always will be, justly regarded as the best and noblest ol all the
poetic creations of the Roman mind, and as one of the choicest
productioris of all literature. There are sashions in criticism as
well as in other things 3 not, indeed, so changeful and transitory
as those os dress, but lashions, neverlheless ; and of late years
some scholam, even eminent scholars, have fallen into the habit

of the Augustan age! This fashion will have its day3 but it can-
not set aside the verdiet of so many generations past. Virgil and
Horace are in no danger. The Aeneid is too grand, too beauti- Ι
ful, too pure, to be despised‚ neglected‚ or lost.

grief and suffering it takes hold os our sympathies with all the
power os the most affecting tragedy. What asublime epie of itsels

is the account ol the sack os Troy l what a tragedy os passion and
late is presented in the story of Dido! lndeed, the student will
find in the Aeneid many dramatic scenes, many vivid pictures of
life and manners, many lively narratives of adventure, any one ol
which would be of itsell a poem, and would secure to its author
an enviable samer
