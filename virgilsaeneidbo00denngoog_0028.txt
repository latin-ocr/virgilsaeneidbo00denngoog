sentiment 3 it was expected to revive and perpetuate great events
in Roman history, and so transmit them to posterity. The Roman,
then, in contrast with the Greek, chose to portray in poetical
form actual historical events, past, or even contemporary, history
that bore witness to the greatness of the nation. Secondly, it was
aRoman instinct to honor great individuals‚ men who achieved
success in arms in the interest of the Roman state. Accordingly
the Roman singled out foremost leaders whom he glorified and
whose name he perpetuated. This tendency also the Roman

The charming narration 01 events in the Homeric poems had
affected Roman as well as Greek, and many a dramatic action in
both languages took for its subject oue of these heroic legends.
Now the story of Aeneas, in the later developed form in which
Virgil found it, is the only one 01 1131101131 significance that is

the story 01 Aeneas was further influenced by the fact that
