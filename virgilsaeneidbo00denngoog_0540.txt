NOTES—BOOK VI· ·

4¹7· regna :accusative with personat. cf. l 171,

418. adverso: opposite to them as they land.

42⁰· Melle soporatam - offam: ‘a calce made stupefying with honey and ¹
drugged rneal.¹ Soporatam cannot strictly apply to melle, and must be re·
garded here as joined with it by a kind of zeugma. In strictness the lauguage
would be melle imbutam etsrugr'bus medicatis soporatam. Ἴ

421. fame: H. 145,3; A. 59, 2‚b; G. 68, 8; (H. 137, 2).

4²4. Occupat: ‘gaina '3 seizing the tinre before the dog shall recover from
the opiate. sepulto: ie. in somno. Cf. 11, 265.

425. Evaditque ripam: ‘escaping from the bank! Evadit is used with
reference to the threatened hindrance interposed by the watchdog. Τὴε
verb with -que appended, as frequently, may be rendered by a participle.

426-439. Aeneas first comes to the abode of those who have died in infancy,
and of those who have been put to death under false accusatione, or who have
been impelled by the hardships of life to commit suicide.

427· in limine primo: ‘at the very threshold.¹ Having passed by the
cave where the watchdog lies, he now enters by a gateway the dwelling place
of the shades. ’

430. mortis: for the case, see note on voti, V, 237.

431. Nee sine sorte, etc.: the customs of the Romans are here alluded
to. The description is purposely vague, since herc, as in other passages of
description, the poet is not bound to definiteness of detail, but such descrip- Ι
tions everywhere must be judged rather from artistic considerations. Minos
as quaesitor, praetor, or presiding officcr of the court, assigns judges, or jurors
(iudices), to decide on the case of each individual. These jurors he appoints
by drawing lots from au urn (orovet urnam). Conington supposes sedes to
refer to the abodes of the shades in general, and not alone to those of the class
Just mentioned.

432, 433. ille-discit: ‘he both summons the assemhly of the silent
(shades) and investigates their lives and their transgressions'; i.e. it is his
prerogative to sammon them before the court, and to investigate and decide
each case according to the method of procedure above explained.

43⁶· aethere in alto: see note on l. 128.

440-476. Aeneas next arrives at the fields of mourning (lugentes canopo),
where ‹lwell the shades of such as have in any way come toan untimely end
on account of love. Here he meets Dido, and in vain tries to obtain her for·

giveness.

440. partem fusi in omnem: ‘extending in every direction.’
442. quos: the masculine, because both sexes are included.
