tion. The literary cpio, of which the Aeneid is the representative,
is the product of a different and alater epoch in civilization 3 it
is less spontaneous and so more artificial. lt presupposes a long
development in the literary history ofa people, and implies on
the part of the poet extraordinary powers of arranging and com-

In the second place, the Aeneid is, as we have seen, a national
epic‚ while the Iliad aud Odyssey are epies ol human lif. But

instrument is the strength of faith, submissim, patience, and
endurance3 audit is with this strength that Aeneas encounters
the many dangers and vicissitudes to which he is exposed, and
withdraws from the allurements os ease and pleasure.' Cf. notes

Besides Aeneas the characters that stand out most prominently
are Dido and TumuS, the former dominating the first hals of the
poem, the latter the last half. The character ol the ill-lated queen
Dido is strong. Hers was a generous and trusting, hut pure and

about by divine agency. The queen’s real nature is exhibited
