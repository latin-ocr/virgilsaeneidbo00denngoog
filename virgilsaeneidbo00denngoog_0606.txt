nores-soor< x1 N245

118. leet: for vixisset‚· ‘'(he) would have survived.’ Cf. exlinmm, IV, 606.

125. caelo: dative.

126. restitue, laborum: the genitive with mirer in imitation of the
Greek idiom. Cf. ll. 73 and 416. Ι

130. fatalesmoles: ‘the destined structures’; those which are to form
the city pointed out by fate. It will delight us to aid in building the new
Troy even with our own hands. lt is understood that a permanent city is to
be built on the site of the present camp.

141. Latio: ablative of place, ‘iu Latium’3 better than the dative as
understood by some.

143. lucet via: the escort must have arrived with the body of Pallas iu the
evening. Torches were sometimes borne before the funeral processibus in
Rome, and this custom Virgil here ascribes to the primitive times.

153. Cautius -hfarth Evander is said, above, ll. 47, 48, to have warned
Aeneas of the dangers to be encountered by Pallas in the war. It is implied,
of course, that Pallas himself was cautioned against too much impetuosity.
We may infer that the admonition given to Pallas is now running in the mind
of the old man. monenti, therefore, should be supplied after promissa dederas
parenti. Thus the sense will be: thou hadst not given these promises (prom-
ises of such conduct) to thy father, when warning thee that thou shouldst not
trust thyself rashly, etc. Some editors place a period after parenti and take
utin the sense of utinam, while others regard ut-oelles as explanatory of
promissa, although the construction, promitto ut, is anomalous.

161. secutum: sc. me.

162, 163. obruerent, dedissem, referret: the optative use of the subjunc-
tive. Cf. IV, 678; X, 854.

it did), it will gladden my heart that he fell while leading Trojans against
Latium, aster having slain thousands of the Volsci'

171. Tyrrhenique — Tyrrhenum (genitive plural): ‘both the Etruscan
leaders', and the whole army of the Etruscans) The repetition of the proper
noun has the force of the repetition of the copula.

172. tropaea (eorum virorum) quos. ’

174. Esset: :sifuisset aetas, robur: sc. eius ( = Pallantis).

179, rso. Meritis-locus: ‘for thy services and lor thy fortune this (addi-
tional) opportunity alone is open to thee) Thou canst achieve now only oue
thing more for my benefit and for increasing thy glory, and that thing is the
destruction of Turnus. Meritis and Fortunae are datives (indirect obiect) r
with the verb, vacat,· tibi, dative of reference, nearly equivalent to the genitive
of possession.

181. perferre: ‘to report’; to announce to my son the joyful news of
vengeance achieved. The infinitive depends on quaero.
