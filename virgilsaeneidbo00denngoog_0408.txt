BOOK 11

Aeneas recounts to Dido the capture and sack of Troy.

1-249. After a briei introduction, Aeneas enters upon his narrative, which
begins with the story of the wooden horse. The Greeks, now in the tenth
year of the siege, disheartened by their ill success, resort to stratagem. On
the night which precedes the burniug 'oi the city, they pretend to have aban·
doned the siege, and to have taken ship for Greece3 they leave upon the
plain, before the walls of Troy, an immense fabric ol wood, made to resemble
ahorse, and ol such aize that it can be carried into the city only by enlarging
tbc gato or breaking down a portion oi the wall.

Within this fabric are concealed many ol the Grecian chiefs, while the army,
under the command of Agamemnon, instead ol continuing the voyage, lies
hidden beyond the island of Tenedos, a lew miles from Troy.

The Trojan multitude issues from the gates, aud, gathering round the strange
image, hesitatc whether to convey it into the city or to destroy it.

At this moment the cunning Sinon, wrm has purposely sutiercd himself to
be made prisoner, is brought before King Priam, and by his artlul story gains
the confidence ol the king, and leads him and his people to believe that the
wooden horse, once placed within the citadel, will become, like the Palla·
dium,the saseguard of Troy. The device of Sinon and the Greeks ¹is aided
by Minerva, who sends two serpente to slay the priest Laocodn for attempting
to destroy the image consecrated to her. This prodigy confirms the Trojano
in the purpose already formed: and by means ol ropes and rollers they convey
the wooden horse through the city up to the citadel.
