466-493. The poet seems to have in mind a series of eight pietures, which

we must imagine to be painted under the portico on the outer wall of the '

temple: (1) the victory of the Trojans under Hector; (2) the victory of the
Greeks under Achilles; (3) the death of Rhesus; (4) the death of Troilus;
(5) the Troian matrons before the statue of Minerva; (6) Priam as a suppli-
ant before Achilles; (7) Memnon in battle3 and (8) the battle of the Ama-
zons with the Greeks. ’

467, 468. Hac (sc. parte): ‘here‚’ ‘in this part ’; ie. on this panel: ‘Here
the Greeks were llying, (while) the Trojan youth pursued; here (on the next
panel) the Trojans (were flying, while) the crested Achilles in his chariot
pressed on.' curru: an ablative of the instrument.

469. Nec procul hinc: ‘and not far henee’; from that part of the series

of paintings mentioned in the preceding verses. Rhesi: ‘Rhesus,’aThracian ¹

prince, who had come to the aid of Priam, and encamped on the night of his
arrival outside of the city. According to some post-Homeris accounts, it was
fated that Troy should not fall unless the horses of Rhesus should come into
the possession of the Greeks before they had tasted of the pasturage of Troy

and drunk of the river Xanthus. ln the Iliad, X, 433, Ulysses and Diomedes ³
penetrate into the camp of Rhesus, slay the chief himself and twelve of his ζ

followers, and convey the horses tovthe Grecian camp. niveis velis: ‘with

snowy coverings’; ablative of description. Virgil is thinking of his own ,

times. Huts of twigs and turf wereused in the heroic age.

470. primo proditu somno: “betrayed in their first (and therefore sound· ¹

est) sleep’ Others understand by ‘first sleep’ the sleep of the first night of ’

their arrival.

471. vastabat: ‘was (Just before) devastating.’ He was not represented ,

in the painting as actually engaged in slaughter, but the bodies of the slsis,

scattered around in the picture, suggest this idea. multa caede: better .

with 'vastabat than cruentus.

472. avertit: ‘is leading away,' ‘driving away! This is the immediate i

subject, or, so to speak, the action of the picture.

473. gustassent: the pluperfect is used here after an historical present. ἵ
For the mood‚ see H. 605, 2; LM. 88ο; A. 327; B. ²923 G. 5773 (H. 520, ΙΙ). “

474. Troilus: the youngest son of Priam.

475. atque: connects infelix and impar. Achilli: limits congressus.

476. curru: see note onl.226. resupinus: ‘thrownbackward’ The war
chariot was very short and low, and open behind. Two warriors usually rode
together, one to light and the other to drive. The chariot in this case is empty,
because Troilus is thrown out, and the charioteer‚ perhaps, has been slain.

477. tamen: ‘yet (though he has been thrown out of the chariot).’ .

478. versa hasta: ‘with his inverted spear‚' which being held in the right ³

hand, and thrown backward over his shoulder, trails in the dust as he is ¹
