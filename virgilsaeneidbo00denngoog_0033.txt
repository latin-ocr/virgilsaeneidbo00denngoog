A. 348; B. 363 fol. ; G. 707 fol.; (H. 579)). Certain mechanica}
devices may then be resorted to. Take, for instance, the opening
line of the Third Book. The sixth foot, since it is never a dactyl‚
must consist of but two syllables, here, gentem. The fifth foot is
regularly a dactyl, here, -vcrtcre We have now the first four feet
to determine. The first foot is plainly a spondee, since the Post

iu the first syllable is necessarily long, and the a in ·quam is long,
being followed hy m and r (of res). The fourth foot is also a

spondee since the -i, the sign of the genitive case in Priami, is
long, and by elision there remains but one syllable (pue e-)
before the beginning of the fifth foot. This must be, and as
a matter of fact is, long. Of the remaining syllables composing
the second and third feet, the diphthong -oe in Asiae we know is
long. The only combination possible then is res Asi, and -α
Pria. We thus leam, without consulting a lexicon, that the four ἵ
vowels in Asi· and Pria· are short. ln this way the line may be
read without a previous knowledge of root vowels. The same
method may be applied with like success to many other lines.¹

Caesura, etc, see H. 7²0 sot. ; LM. 1¹09 fol. ; A. 359 fol. 3 B.

- IV. MANUSCRIPTS

The text of Virgil occupies a unique position among the works
of Roman writers in that it was transmitted to us by several very '
ancient manuscripts, These are seven in number, and they date
from the fourth and fifth centuries no. Three are fiagmentary‚
containing only a few leaves while the other four are practically
complete. All are written in the ‘capital’ script, the oldest form
of writing employed in Latin manuscripts. One of the most valu-
able is known as the Schedae Vaticanae. It begins with the third
book of the Georgics and extends through the eighth book of the
