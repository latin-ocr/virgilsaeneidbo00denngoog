Ν 90 VIRGIL'S AENEID

121-191. Aeneas lands in Crete without oppositiou, as King Idomeneus
has fled from the country. His new settlement is soon visited with plague
and famine, and the Penates declare t0 him in a vision that the Dehan oracle
referred not to Crete, but to HesperIa or Italy. Anchises recalls ffie tradi-
tion os the twofold origin of the Trojans (Teucer from Crete, and Dardanus
from Italy), and advises him to set sail for Hesperia.

122. idomenea: accusative of the Greek declension (Ἰδομενῆα). Idome-
neus was one of the most distinguished os the Grecian ehiefs at the siege of
Troy. In fullillment of a vow made during a tempest, to sacrifice to the gods
the first obiect which should meet him on landing in Crete, he was compelled
to make his own son, Merion, the victim. A pestilence which besell the
people soon afterwards being attributed to this act, Idomeneus was expelled
from his country, and, therefore, planted a new domiuion 111 the Sallentina
district of Southern Italy. See below, l. 400, and XI, 264 sq.
