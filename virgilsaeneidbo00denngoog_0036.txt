Aeneid. Itis adorned with interesting miniatures. Of nearly equal
value are the more complete Codex Puluu'nus, and the fragmentary
Scluedac Rescn'ptae Veroneuses, the Verona palimpsest. Slightly
inferior is the‹Codex Mediceus, preserved in the Laurentian Library
of Florence. From asubscrtplio, or note appended to the Eclogues‚
we leam that this manuscript cannot be later than ab. 494. Of
less importance still is the Codex Romanus. Of the seven lead-
ing manuscriptS, the two remaining are so incomplete that they
have little value in determining the text of the poems. ‘They are
the Schedue Rescriptae Sangalleuscs, another palinrpsest which has
but ten leaves preserved,¹ and the Scledae Berolr'uenses or Paulinae,
which has but seven leaves containing each forty lines. The later
manuscripts of Virgil are numerous, thus attesting the popularity
of the poet during the Middle Ages. But few of them, however,
are worthy of any independent consideration when they vary from
the readings of the older capital manuscripts. Ribbeck derives
all existing manuscripts of Virgil from one common original called
an ‘archetypus’ written with but little regard for calligraphy in the
cursive style, and filled with numerous conjectures, glosses, and
interpolations.

No Latin author was quoted more extensively than Virgil by
ancient scholars-and grammarians. Nearly every line may be
found somewhere in the works of later Roman writers, cited word

for word. These quotations are not always oi value in ernending Δ

the text as we receive it in the manuscripts, for in such citations
the memory was relied upon largely‚ and no need was felt of con-
firming the reading by reference toa reliable manuscript. We
know that Virgil‘s Aeneid was used as a text book in Roman
schools also. An interesting confirmation of this are the scratch-
ings upon the walls of ancient Pompeii of the opening lines of both
the first and second books, Arma virumque cano and Conticuere
ornnes, lessons that the school children were conning on their way
to or from school.

Some writers, as Aulus Gellius (second century n.n.), Nonius
Marcellus (third century), and Macrobius (fourth century), often
