the wound, holds him back (though) struggling (to force himself forward)
on his coils (nodis), and winding himself into his own folds.’

279. Nixantem: refers to the action of the unwounded portion of his

body first described ; with this he vainly struggles to pull himself along by Ι

throwing it into contortions‚ while he twists the joints (neentbro) of the
wounded part, or part below the wound‚ upon themselves3 ie. into coil
within coil. nodis: ‘knots’3 denotes the alternate contractiori and exten·
sion of the joints‚ either vertical or horizontal‚ which in the snake are the
means of motion, and which, in this case, when he is struggling violently,
rise into large, undulating knots.

281. Vela tacit: ‘unfurls the sails.'

281. promisso munere: no particular reward hasbeen mentioned 11 the
narrative, but we may infer from l. 305 that in the ship race also, none was
