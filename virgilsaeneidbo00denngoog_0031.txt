22 VIRGIL’S AENEID

when she believes herself betrayed by the voluntary act of Aeneas,
’ for she scouts the idea of divine interposition.

Turnus is everywhere characterized by violentia, ‘blind vehe-
mence of spirit‚’ and may be intended to typify the lawlessness
and lack of civilization of the primitive Italic tribeS, not unmixed
with bravery‚ which the Romans were destined to restrain and
subdue. The fate of this daring Italian chief inspires one with
compassionate interest as he strives to repel the foreign invaders
and win back his promised bride.

Other characters full of personal interest are PallaS, the brave
but unfortunate son of Evander 3 Nisus and Euryalus, who

attempted and almost succeeded in carrying to Aeneas the news ¹

of the Trojans besieged within their camp; the tendet and faith-
ful Creusa, who by the fates was not permitted to leave Troy with
her husband and son 3 the aged Acestes, who performs the part
of the kindly host to the sea-tossed Trojans ; Anchises, whose
untimely death the reader bewails with Aeneas3 and Camilla, the
brave heroine, whose early life, prophetie of her future, is related

by Diana, and who was destined to die in the last encounter with
the Trojans. '

ΙΙΙ. THE METER

Virgil's works are written in a verse known as the dactylic hex·
ameter; each line consists of six feet, and each foot, with the
possible exception of the last, is either a dactyl (-υυ> or the

equivalent, a spondee (..-). Accordingly each foot contains l

four units (a short syllable, υ, being a imit), which must be com·

bined in the form of either one long and two short syllables i

(-υυ) or two long ones (- ->. The fifth foot is regularly a

dactyl, but sometimes, though rarely, it may be a spondee, as, eg. 3
ll, 68, Ill, 12, V, 320. Such a line is termed spondaic. Since ἵ
in every Latin verse the last unit is indifferent, ie. may be used 3
or omitted according to the will of the poet, the last foot of the
dactylic hexameter may even consist of one long and one short ¹
