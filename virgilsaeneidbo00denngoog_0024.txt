founder of the Julian family; he therefore called this work, which
he divided into twelve books, the Aeneid. He had already heen
employed eleveu years upon his task, and had not yet put to it the ·
finishing hand, when he was overtaken by his last sickness. He
made a voyage to Greece‚ with the intention of visiting Attica and
Asia On arriving at Athens he met Augustus, who happened to
be at that time retuming from Asia Minor to Italy. Virgil was
easily persuaded ¹hy his friend and patron to return with him imme-
diately to Rome, but he was destined never again to see the capital
city. His malady had continually increased during the voyage,
and a few days after landing at Brundisium he expired. His death
occurred in nc. 19. His remains were conveyed from Brundisium
to Naples, and buried on the hill of Posilippo, in the tomb still pre·
served and revered as the ‘lomb of Virgil’ ·

There are no authentic portrait busts of Virgil. Outside of lit-
erary sources, our only knowledge of the personal appearance of
the poet is derived from miniatures of some existing manuscripts,
notably the Codex Romanus, and from two mosaics. One of these
mosaics was discovered at Trier in 1884. The other, a represen-
tation of which forms the Frontispiece of this hook, was found at
Susa in Tunis, in 1896.ι It is about three feet square. In the
center sits the poet, clothed in a white toga having a blue horder.
His feet rest upon a footstool. He holds a partly open scroll on
which are the words r —

‘Musa mihi causas memora, quo nurnine laeso,
Quidve . . ,Ψ

This is sufficient to identify the poet. On one side stands Clio,
the muse of history, reading from aroll 3 on the other is Melpo-
mene, muse of tragedy, identified as such by the tragic mask which
she holds. The mosaic dates probably from the first century nn.

The literary history of Virgil during the Middle Ages affords a
most interesting study. His farne as a poet was never dimin-¹
