tive with a passive participle, with the reflexive force os the Greek Middle

now in the gallery of the Louvre, corresponds to this description. The dress
consists ot two pieces, the tunic underneath, and the mantle over it. The
tunic is shortened by being partially drawn up underneath the girdle, and
allowed to sall over it in a told, thus bringing the bottom os the tunic a
little above the knee. The light mantle is then t'olded, and knotted round
the waist. It seems to be this gathering up os the tunic and knotting ot' the
mantle that Virgil has in mind.
