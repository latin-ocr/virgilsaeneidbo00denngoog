these, the lowest five strata are prehistoric, the second stratum dating, it is esti·
mated, from about 3000 nc. The sixth stratum is the most important and the
most interesting, since this is theone that actually represents the Pergamos of
Homer and the ancient Troia of Virgil. Remains of seven large buildings were
discovered, of a construction that resembles that of the ancient sites of Tiryns and
of Mycenae, the horne of Agamemnon. Upon the acropolis were found remains
of au ancient temple, surrounded by a wall of fortification, having a strong tower at
the northeast angle. Traces of fire were also discovered.

BOOK 111 .

The voyages and settlements of Aeneas before his arrival at
Carthage. ’ “

THE time embraced in the narrative of this book is nearly seven years. It
begins with the events immediately succeeding the sall of Troy, which oc-
curred traditionally in 1184 nc. The Trojan fugitives, under the command
of Aeneas, spent the remainder of the summer, and the following winter, in
building ships in the ha'rbor of Antandros (sub Antandro), a city on the
southern side of Mount Ida. This was the first year, i.e. the first summer
and winter, after the fall of Troy. The second year begins with the depar-
tureos the exiles (early in the summer) sor Thrace, and is spent in the
attempt to establish a colony there (ll. 13-69). In the third year the new
colony, called Aenos, or, as some think, Aenea, is abandoned, and the wan-
derers, stopping at Delos to consult the oracle (l. 73), proceed to Crete (l.
131), and commence the colony of Pergameum (ll. 132-134). Having
passed the fourth year and part of the fifth in Crete, they are compelled by a
pestilence to give up this settlement also (l. 190), and sail to Actium in
Acarnania, where they remain during the fifth winter (l. 284). They resume

' their voyage in the beginning of the sixth summer, and first landing near

Buthrotum, and meeting with Helenus and Andromache (ll. 294-505)‚ they
cross the Adriatic to Portus Veneris, in Apulia (l. 523), and srom thence con·
tinue their voyage along the coasts of Italy and Sicily to Drepanum (l. 707),
which they reach at the close of the sixth summer, and where soon alter-
wards Anchises dies (l. 710). ln the beginning of the following, or seventh
summer (see l, 34sqq.), they start for naly, but are immediately driven by a
storm to the coast of Africa.

· 1-68. Aeneas, with twenty ships, built in Antandros, pasees over to Thrace
and attempts his first settlement of Aenea, or Aenos. After commencing his

colony, he is warned by the shade of the murdered Polydorus to flee from
Thrace, and again sets sail with his followers
