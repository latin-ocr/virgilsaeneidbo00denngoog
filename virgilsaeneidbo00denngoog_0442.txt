⁷29· Suspensum: ‘anxious’ comiti: see l. 711.

731. Evasisse: ‘to have passed through in safety.’ Aeneas now relatos
the sudden panic which the near approach of a party os Greeks occasioned,

cursu: cf. 1, 157.

737. nota regione: ‘from the familiar direction.'

738-740. The irregular construction and arrangement are occasioned by
deep emotion. Below (l. 788), the ghost os Credsa reveals to Aeneas that
she is in the service of the goddess Cybele, but leaves him uncertain how she
was taken away ; and this is still a mystery at the time when Aeneas is tell-
ing the story. ‘Alast did my wile Creusa, torn from me,unhappywretch!
bysate, remain hehind? did she wander from the path? did she sit down
weary? (Itis) uncertain? The questions are probably direct. The first in-
terrogative, ·ne, would come regularly after misero. For the case of misero,
see note on 1. 735. nec connects incertum (est) and est reddita.

741. Nec amissam respexi animumve reflexi: ‘but Ι did not look back
lor the lost one, or turn my thoughts (to her).’ respexi: in its literal sense.

For the omission ol ad, see note on I, 2.

744. Defuit-fefellit: ‘she alone was missing, and was lost by her
companions,’ etc.

745. amens: causal; ‘in my madness.’ ·que: is joined, in scanning‚ with
the following verse. See note on Ι, 332.

746. eversa: see note on l. 413.

747-804. Aeneas returns through the city, and wanders everywhere in
search of Creiisa, even venturing into the midst os the Greeks, who now hold
complete possession. The shade os Creiisa appears to him, consoles his grief,
assures him of her happiness, and predicts his final settlement in Italy. He
returns to his friends, who have been joined in the meantime by a multitude
ol fugitives, and conducts them to Mount Ida.

748. recondo: cf. the use ol occulit, Ι, 312.
749. cingor: with middle sense. Cf.l. 383. Aeneas had given his wesp-
ons to his attendants, while carrying his father.
