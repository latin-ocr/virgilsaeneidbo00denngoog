Of the preeminent worth ol Virgil’s poemS, and ol their impor-
tance as literary studies, the most striking prool is presented in the
lact that so many of the classics of modern poetry, in all cultivated
languages, have manifestly been produced under the molding and

eulogies ever bestowed by any poet upon a brother poet: —

‘Glory and light of all the tuneful train!

May it avail me that l long with zeal

Have sought thy volume, and with love immense

Thou he, from whom alone I have derived

That style, which lor its beauty into fame

Exalts me.'¹

likely to allect any form of narrative poetry among the Romans.
