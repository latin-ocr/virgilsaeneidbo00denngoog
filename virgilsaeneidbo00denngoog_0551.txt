marble. Δ ·
730. ollis Seminibus: ‘to these seeds' oi being; these sparks from the all-
pervading lire, or principle oi vitality and thought.

731. quantum: this ethereal force nraniiests itself especially in man, ‘so iar
as' the banelul influences of the animal passions do not impede its working.

733. Hinc: ‘hence ’; by reason of this, i.e. from the debasing union ol the
body with the soul, implied in the preceding clause. Fear‚ desire, grief, and
joy were all regarded, especially‘by the Stoics, as weak allections contracted
by the soul from the body. auras: here, ‘the pure air'; the upper region
oi the heavens (caelum) frorn which they sprung.

734. clausae: sc. animae.

740-742. The punishments inflicted for the purification of souis are varied
according to the nature and degree of the guilt eontracted in lile, Exposure
to the winds suffices for one class; others must be purged beneath a great guli
of water, while the deepest infection is purged by fire.

742. infectum scelus: ‘the contracted guilt.’

743. Quisque—Manes: ‘we sutler each his peculiar punishments.’ Manes
signifies: (1) the shades ol the dead; (2) Hades, or the abode oi the shades3

.(3) avenging powers os the lower world; (4) penalties inflicted by these
powers. It seems to be used here in the last sense. The idea of the whole
, passage (ll. 743-751) seems to be this: we are all punishcd lor actual sin
with penalties more or less severe, which require more or less time, accord·
ing to the degree ol the 'moral infection. Thereupon (after punishment)
we are admitted to 'vast Elysium,¹ and a few ol us, who, hy the special
favor oi the gods, are not destined to go again into other bodies, like these
great multitudes (see ll. 713sqq.), but are permitted to retain our identity,
occupy these blissful fields until we are free from the very last traces oi inbred
impurity (Concrelam labem). We thus become once more unmixed, ethereal,
fiery essence, as at the first. But all these, to whom earthly bodies are again
allotted by fate, are conducted after the lapse of a thousand years to the bor-
ders of Lethe, and prepared by its oblivious waters to enter upon that new
existence. Anchises, and such as he (pauci), who were already deitied in
the minds ol their descendants, are represented as not subject to the sate of

Ἰ the great multitude of shades destined to be transsormed into other men;

ie. Anchises must continue to exist as Anchises until his soul resumes its orig-
inal condition asa part oi the universal soui Hence there is a marked con-
trast intended between pauci and Has omnes.¹
