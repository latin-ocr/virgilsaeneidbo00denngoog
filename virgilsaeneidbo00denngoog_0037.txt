who commentated on Virgil's poems are M. Valerius Probus (latter
part of the first century no), Aelius Donatus (fourth century),
and Servius (fourth century), the most samous of the Virgilian
commentators.

V. EDITIONS AND HELPFUL BOOKS

The first printed edition of Virgil, the ‘editio princeps,’ was
published in Rome about 1469. The first edition from the Aldine
press appeared in 1501, and during the sixteenth century a large
number of editions were printed. Not until the seventeenth
century, however, do the really critical texts and commentaries
appear.

numerous later reprints), Heinsius (1676), Burmann (1746),
Heyne (1767-1775), the ‘same revised and edited by Wagner
