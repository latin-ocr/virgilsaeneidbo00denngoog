vigor, the poetryof Ennius was harsb and rugged to adegree which
rendered it to the more cultivated tastes oi later generations almost
intolerable. Nor by the poets who succeeded Ennius had any
such improvement been made in the. composition of Ι Latin verse
as to admit 01 any comparison between them and their Greek
nrodels. It was reserved for two 'great poets oi Rome, two con-
genial spirits, filled with the most lively admiration of each other,
laboring side by side, both striving earnestly for the same object-
¹ it was reserved for Virgil and Horace to elevate the national poetry
to a character worthy 01 Rome, to develop all the resources oi their
noble language, and to make it flow in both heroic and lyric verse
with all the grace and dignity that had hitherto been characteristic
01 the Greek alone.

After the publication of the Eclogues, Virgil appears to have
passed the remainder 01 his life chiefly at Naples. His feeble
health was probably the occasion 01 this.

It was here that he composed the Georgics, a didactic poem in
four books, in which he endeavors to recall the ltalians to their
primitive but long-neglected pursuit of agriculture. In point ol
versification this is the most finished of the works 01 the poet, and,
indeed, as Addison remarks, it may be regarded as in this respect
the most perfect 01 311 poems. In the first book he treats 01 the
management of fields, in the second 01 trees, in the third 01 horses
and cattle, and in the fourth 01 bees. He has gatbered into this
poem all the experience of the ancient ltalians on these subjects,
and he has contrived to make thern attractive by associating them
with wonderful beauty 01 diction and imagery, and with charming

’ variety 01 illustration.

Having devoted seven years, from rac. 37, to the writing of this
work, and conscious tlrat his poetic labors must'be ended by an
early death, be now entered upon a long-cherished plan of conr-
posing an epic in the Homeric style, which should at once
commemorate the glory 01 Rome and of Augustus, and win back
the Romans, if possible, to the religious virtues of their progenitors.
