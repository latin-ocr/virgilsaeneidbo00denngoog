144 ire: see note on aaaron, l. 134 mari: ablative absolute with re·
menso, as pelago remensa, ΙΙ, 181. The deponent has here, as osten, a passive
signification. veniam precari: the favor to be asked of Apollo is a revela·
tion, informing them ‘what end, etc.'; the clauses introduced by quam, unde,
and quo are thus dependent on the idea of responding or instructing implied
in veniam.

being able to relieve them by declaring what the fates decree concerning

ad aethera, l. 462, of the glory os the descendants of Aeneas in general.

airis, or rebus ,· or dis, ie. the Trojan Penates, who are speaking.
