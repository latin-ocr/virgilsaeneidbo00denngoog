syllable (-υ). The normal dactyllc hexameter may then be
represented thus : —

Rhythm in English verse depends upon the strong word stress
which prevails in this language; it results from the collocation of
words in such a manner as to produce a regularly recurring
accent. In the Latin language, on the other hand, the accent of
the individual word was very slight. ln poetry, therefore, there
was another basis for metrical rhythm, narnely, the regular recur-
rence of long and short syllables.¹ ln this respect, both in prose·
and poetry‚ Latin differs radically from English, namely, in its ·
practice of giving more time (theoretically twice as rnuch) to the
pronunciation of certain vowels than it does to others. The
English language is accentual, the Latin is quantitative.

Since the quantitative character is as trnly present in prose as
in poetry, it follows that if one read Latin poetry as he should
read Latin prose, that is, with a proper observance, in his pro·
nunciation, of long and short syllables² the metrical flow would
be apparent without any further ellort on the part of the reader.
But since our own language has an entirely different basis for its
verse, it is at first difficolt to read Latin poetry quantitatively.
Only abundant practice will make it easy and enjoyable.

Very often a lach of perfect familiarity with the length of root
vowels is a hindrance to the reader. The student should first of
⁴ all know fairly well the quantity of final syllables. He will get
information on this in his grammars (H. 691 fol.; LM. 1096 fol.;

¹Compare in this connection Bennett, The Quantitatlve Reading ol Latin
Poetry,Boston,1899; What was lctus in Latin Prosody? American Journal os
Philology, vol. XIX, pp. 361tot.; and Hale‚ The Roman Pronunciation of Latin,
in Sctool Review, 1898, pp. 394 fol.

²Pnpils should carelully distinguish between a long vowel and a long syllable.
Along syllable may be one (1) which contains a long vowel followed by a single
consonant, or (2) which contains a long vowel followed by two or more conso·
nahts, or (3) even one which contains a short vowel if followed by two or more
consonante. Thus tempore is Just as much a dactyl as stamine.
