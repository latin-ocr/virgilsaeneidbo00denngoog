N 154 VIRGIL’S AENEID

604—699. The hurning of the ships. While the gamas are in progresa
Juno sends Iris down-to excite discontent among the Trojan women, who are
assemhled near the shore, not witnessing the gamm, hut gazing mournfully on
thesea, whilethey bemoan the death of Anchises While they are grieving
that so much of the sea is still to he crossed, and that they cannot put an end
to their hardships by settling in Sicily, Iris presents herself in the form of
Bero'e', a Trojan matron, and gives utterance to the feelings which lill them
all. They are roused to fury, and, seizing firebrands from the altars of Nep·
tune, on which sacrifices are burning near the water, they hurl them into the
ships. Presently the alarm is conveyed by Eumelus to the Trojan assembly at
the tomh of Anchises. Ascanius, having scarcely completed the cavalry exer-
cise‚ hastens on his horse, followed by Aeneas and the rest, to extinguish the
lire.v But it has already penetrated into the holds of the ships, and all human
efforts are unavailing. Aeneas then calls upon Jupiter, who answers his
prayer by sending down a tlood of rain, and preserving all the ships save four.
